# Classification-with-Logistic-Regression


Logistic regression is a probabilistic, linear classifier. It is parametrized by a weight matrix W and a bias vector b. 
Classification is done by projecting an input vector onto a set of hyperplanes, each of which corresponds to a class. 
The distance from the input to a hyperplane reflects the probability that the input is a member of the corresponding class.
